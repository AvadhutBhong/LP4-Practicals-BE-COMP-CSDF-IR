Artificial intelligence encompasses the broader field of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking. Machine learning is one of its most active research areas, focusing on teaching computers to learn from data. These systems use statistical techniques to find patterns and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming.

While traditional programming requires specific rules, machine learning algorithms can adapt and improve through experience. This approach has revolutionized many fields, from healthcare diagnostics to financial forecasting. Neural networks, particularly deep learning models, have shown remarkable success in tasks like image and speech recognition.
